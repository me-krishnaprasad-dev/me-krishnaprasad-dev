## 🎉 Fun Fact
I once wrote a recursive function to order pizza—needless to say, I got a lot of slices!

## 🏆 Motto
"Code like nobody’s watching, debug like everyone is!"

## 🌟 Something Unique
I love building distributed systems that scale, but I also scale up my coffee intake during deployments. When not coding, you’ll find me trying to optimize my Rubik’s Cube solve time or exploring obscure algorithms just for fun.
